MDL Talent Hub will utilize PIDS technologies (IPFS, CXO, etc), which will allow information to be stored in a distributed manner on users’ devices and miners, raising access, speed, and security of information much higher.
 
In order to compensate our users and miners we will establish bounty program by which anyone can get a certain number of MDL Tokens for storing info about talents, events, and so forth. Received in such a way, MDL Tokens can be spent on MDL Talent Hub for other valuables or exchanged to other crypto or fiat currency.
 
At the moment there are two promising technologies that we might utilize in future, which are InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Skyledger (CXO). IPFS is already operating and all media materials from our blog are stored there, although mining is not yet enabled. However we expect that sooner or later it will be possible to earn bounty by mining data in IPFS.
 
Skyledger, in turn, is a newly developing phenomenon, but is strongly backed by the IT community. Participants in the Skywire community will be able to set up their hardware or Skywire miners to power the MDL network, providing access for photos, videos, and all necessary metadata.
 
Skyledger is the “new internet” and we’re all excited to be building together and thrilled to be the first working app in this environment.
