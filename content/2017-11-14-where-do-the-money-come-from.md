In order to keep our financial flows positive we are considering the following methods of revenue creation. Innovative streams are enabled due to the use of blockchain technology.

**Traditional Streams**

  1.Extended functionality

  We will give a chance to be outstanding for our VIP participants. Extended functionality will allow bookers to be more knowledgeable and talents to be more presentable and thus it will make them both more active on the market.

  2.Commission from transactions

  This is a basic feature of any marketplace and our aim is to make it worth to be. We are not going to charge unreasonable commissions, but instead our aim is to keep them as low as possible, for about 1-2% or even less.  

  3.Target advertising

  Our platform will consolidate several artistic niches, so it will be perfect place for target advertisement. Although it is important to keep in mind that targeted advertisement is supposed to be as soft as possible. So that only meaningful and engaging materials will be allowed.

**Innovative Streams**

  1. Reputation-based partnership programs with brands
  
Talents are special. They are more than average because of their skills, appearance, and personality. People look at them more often. So why don’t they get a discount on some products or services and became a live advertisement? The higher the talent reputation, the higher the discount! Credibility of talent reputation is powered by blockchain technology and transactions are supported with MDL Token. This is advertisment sharing.

  2. Prosumer ecosystem marketplace

   Often talents use extremely customised equipment or costumes which is not possible to find in ordinal shops, so they create themselves! Crafted costumes, equipment, supplies and else are all tradable/rentable commodities and on our MDL platform it will be so easy to get involved in these market relations using MDL token.

  3. Live broadcasting

  Life of talents is unusual - every new event is like an adventure. So why don’t show it to others and get paid a bit? Payments will be supported by MDL Token. With deducted commission of course.
