In current state of global blockchain development, it seems that most people absolutely forgot that behind every project there are actual people working [or not]. So a stylish website with a geeky promising video, featuring Bitcoin or Ethereum addresses, gets people more attracted to invest, than a hardworking community, with respect-worthy leaders. People just send money blindly to a smart contract, without researching who's working on the concept, code, marketing, etc.
True KYC or due diligence should be performed on the both sides, otherwise the wild west and a good luck occurs.
MDL takes a different approach, at least at the time of PRE-ITO. Instead of doing formal KYC, we want to know our investors ourselves and we think it's important to let them understand us better too. During January's PRE-ITO, we are ready to answer the questions and be responsive as much as it is physically possible.

***Why did we choose WAVES platform for PRE-ITO?***

Frankly, none of our team members ever was active in Waves community. But we had a vast knowledge of some Ethereum projects while being experienced investors with ERC20s. The problem is. ETH user experience still far away from what people expect from it. This problem doesn't seem to change any time soon and the current state of congestion with Ethereum network doesn't allow not only the first useful apps (ICOs + crypto kitties) to show its potential to the world, but it simply shows that putting entire world into one single database [which blockchain de-facto is] is probably not the best idea. Vitalik and his team did great job, they helped crypto community grow and opened eyes to many, but they underestimated the impact it was about to bring to the world. Instead of fighting congestion wars with all those ERC20s, while letting our investors waste tons of money on transaction fees, we have been happy users of Sasha's creation: it'll allow MDL team achieve our initial crowdfunding goals and focus on what's important - building great product. MDL is not surfing the blockchain crypto wave, we're riding the industrial revolution 4.0 vibes.

***Why do we choose Skycoin tech / Skyledger?***

MDL is [currently] not a dapp or a mere bunch of smart contracts. We see blockchain as important part of technical evolution. Most importantly - all the blockchains in our eyes are databases. Yes, databases with their peculiar attractive properties of being distributed and immutable. Ethereum is trying to put entire world into one database; but for us as a startup it's important to make sure that technologies we're using are solid and well tested. As it was very well put on skycoin's github, Skycoin improves on Bitcoin [and hence most of its forks] in too many ways to be addressed here. Instead we suggest to have a look into their blog and maybe even glance at the whitepapers.

***How will transition to the MDL mainnet happen?***

Through a gateway. MDL mainnet will be based on Sky's codebase, therefore inheriting its precious qualities. Skycoin's OTC have proven to its team and the community that it works well, code of which everybody can observe and analyze at github.com/skycoin/teller. We're simply adding support for WAVES node, work on which has already started.

***Why we are happy?***

Well, you still should be cautious and never invest more than it's crucial for you to lose in the case of global emergency. Nobody in MDL project is insured against an earthquake or sudden tsunami. The thing will be workable according to our roadmap in any case.

Happy 2018, Ladies and Gentlemen!
MDL, Roman Tronenko, CTO
